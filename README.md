## How To Use This Code

These examples are intended to be run in an IDE. There is no configuration for running standalone.

Clone the repo and open it in your IDE. Your IDE should recognise that it is a [Gradle](https://gradle.org) project and download jsoup automatically. Then you can run the Example classes directly in your IDE - each one has a `main` method.
